    <h1>AERA OF CIRCLE</h1></font>

   <font color="blue"><h2>Circle is a very important geometric figure. In our everyday life, we see circular objects around us, such as a bangle, a coin, a bike wheel, etc. In order to know more about circles, it is important that we understand the terms related to circles, like radius, diameter, perimeter, area of the circle, etc. One such important parameter, the area of a circle, is the region occupied by a circle in two dimensions.</h2></font>

     <h2>
        In this section, we will learn how to find the area of a circle. At the last of this section, we have explained some examples related to the area of a circle with different scenario for better understanding.

             Circle: A circle can be defined as a locus (a set of points in a particular position) of points that maintain equidistant from another point called the center. In other words, a circle is a geometrical shape whose distance from the center to the edge is always the same. Every circle has a center.

            A circle has the following components:
         </h2>
     </font>

 <br>
 <h2>
     1) Origin: It is a point that lies exactly at the center of a circle is called the origin. It is denoted by o.

 <h2>
     2) Radius: The distance from the radius to circumference is called the radius. In other words, it is half of the diameter. It is denoted by r.
     r=d/2
 </h2>

 <br>
 <h2>
     3) Diameter: It is the length of a line that splits a circle into two equal parts is called the diameter. The line should be passed through the center. In other words, the diameter is twice the radius of a circle. It is denoted by d.
     d = 2r
 </h2>

 <br>
 <h2>
     4) Chord: The line whose endpoints lie on the circle is called a chord. In other words, it is a line that joins two points on any curve. Every diameter is a chord. But not every chord is a diameter. In the following figure, the line segment AB is a chord.

    <bold>WHAT DOES EXACTLY AREA OF CIRCLE MEANS?</bold>
 </h2>
 <h2>
    The reign occupied by a circle in the 2D plane is called the area of a circle. In other words, all the space covered by the circle's circumference is called the area of a circle.

 </h2>
 <h2>
    In the following figure, the portion in the green colour represents the area of the circle.

    Area of Circle Formula
 </h2>
 <br>
 <h2>
    A = πr2
 </h2>

 <h2>
    Where
 </h2>
 <h2>
    A: represents the area of a circle.
 </h2>
 <h2>
    π: is a constant whose value is 3.1415 or 22/7.
 </h2>
 <h2>
    r: represents the radius of a circle
